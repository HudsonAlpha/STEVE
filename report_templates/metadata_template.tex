\section{Sample metadata}
\subsection{General Sample Info}
This section contains information regarding where samples were acquired from.  This corresponds to the ``Sample'' label in Table \ref{tab:sample_metadata}.

\subsection{Training Samples}
This section contains information regarding the specific samples used for analysis.  This data is automatically pulled from a sample JSON file containing sample names, sample types (i.e. which GIAB sample), and how the sample was prepared.  Table \ref{tab:sample_metadata} contains the list of metadata as pulled from the JSON.

% NOTE TO USER: if samples are added, make sure the sample JSON is updated or it won't get caught
